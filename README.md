### Attribute Information: The dataset are related to red and white variants of the "Vinho Verde" wine. Vinho verde is a unique product from the Minho (northwest) region of Portugal. Medium in alcohol, is it particularly appreciated due to its freshness (specially in the summer).

1 - fixed acidity

2 - volatile acidity

3 - citric acid

4 - residual sugar

5 - chlorides

6 - free sulfur dioxide

7 - total sulfur dioxide

8 - density

9 - pH

10 - sulphates

11 - alcohol Output variable (based on sensory data):

12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

## We will do Unsupervised learning using K-means Clustering alogorithm also we will build a Dendogram. We will use Silhouette_Coefficient to find best No of Cluster. 

# Let's look at the jupyter notbook file for more details.
